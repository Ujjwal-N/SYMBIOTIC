# SYMBIOTIC
SYMBIOTIC is a a permission-less IoT data sharing network implemented on Ethereum. Please see paper.pdf for all relevant details and read through the Abstract and Introduction Section. Note that the paper is about 95% complete.

Code relevant to the implementation and experimentation of SYMBIOTIC is stored in hardhat/REUProj. hardhat/REUProj/contracts stores the relevant Solidity smart contract code(implementation). hardhat/REUProj/scripts/simulateNetwork.js stores the relevant javascript simulation code to run experiments.

The auxiliary folder stores tools and resources used to generate the paper and code.
